🏛️🎭 CulturAI Curator – AI-Powered Cultural Artifact Explorer
🧠 Project Idea:
CulturAI Curator is an interactive AI agent designed to help students, tourists, and enthusiasts explore cultural artifacts, monuments, and traditions from around the world. Users can upload images (e.g., of a painting, temple, dance costume, sculpture), and the AI identifies the region, cultural significance, style, and provides related learning content. The agent also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer cultural questions using local knowledge sources.

🌍 Key Features:
Feature	Description
🖼️ Artifact Recognition	Upload an image and get cultural background, type, and region
🔎 Region & Art Style Identifier	Detects whether it's Mughal, Dravidian, Japanese Ukiyo-e, Greek, etc.
📖 Cultural Fact Generator	Learn facts, traditions, and stories behind the object
🧠 AI Cultural Agent	Ask general cultural or historical questions (powered by Ollama)
📚 RAG with Offline Sources	Queries local .txt or .md files about global cultures using FAISS
🗂️ Timeline / Period Mapping	Map objects to historical periods (e.g., 13th century India)
